### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was the original lab. The first lab that I ever had that taught me so much. I did not choose it because of how easy it is. I chose it because it taught myself the basics. It lead to the knowledge I know now. The lab was actually very enjoyable due to the fact that it was the first steps to coding. I had zero prior knowledge to coding but Lab 1 completely changed that. 

* Lab 5

    Lab 5 part-1 was interesting to me because it was one of the labs that wanted us to first set up the equation then had to plug in factors into the equation we made. It was a bit confusing a first but it was enjoyable. It also showed me that code can actually compute and solve to show the area of a rectangle.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 part-1 was a bit more difficult for myself. It was fun mkaing the code determine what is a sandwich and what is not. ADding different variables like protein, bread, and condiments made it much more difficult for myself. I overall enjoyed Lab 8 but part-1 was a bit tricky at first.
